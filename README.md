# 👩‍💻 Fadeela Naqash
  Aspiring Secure Java Full-Stack Developer | Passionate about building reliable and scalable web apps

## 🔍 About Me

- 🎓 I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology** and will soon be **pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** to further strengthen my skills in web development and computer science.
- 💡  I’m passionate about secure full-stack development because I believe in creating web applications that protect users' data and provide seamless experiences.
- 🌱 Currently, I’m learning to build a custom **Java HTTP server** to integrate frontend and backend—gaining hands-on experience in:
  - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - **Backend**: Java (OOPs), JDBC, MySQL
  - This is part of my effort to develop a complete **vanilla Java full-stack project** without using frameworks so as to gain clarity of concepts.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
- HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript (Vanilla) - building interactive UIs
- **Backend**: Core Java(Basics, OOPs, DSA), Exception Handling, Advanced Java(JDBC) - server-side logic and data management
- **Database**: MySQL, MS SQL Server (RDBMS)
- **Tools**: npm, Git, GitHub, VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA
- **Random Exploration**: Python(basics, oops), C(basics), C++(basics)

## Skills to learn next**:
 - **Frontend**:- Web accessibility > Responsiveness > Figma > Advanced Javascript (Async js, es6, fetch api, modularization, Object Property Access, DRY principles) > React > Projects
 - **Backend**:- File Handling > Multithreading > Request and Response Cycle > Spring > Spring Boot > Projects
 - **Database**:- MongoDB (Document Data Model) > Projects
 - Then, I plan to build framework-based projects using Spring Boot and React to gain solid full-stack experience, followed by diving into cybersecurity.
