**Aspiring Secure Java Full-Stack Developer | Passionate about building reliable and scalable web apps**

## 🔍 About Me  
🎓 Bachelor’s in Information Technology, soon pursuing MCA to deepen my web dev and CS knowledge.  
💡 Passionate about secure full-stack web development — I aim to build web apps that are robust, secure, and user-friendly.  
🌱 Currently building a custom Java HTTP server to integrate frontend and backend with:  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Backend: Java (OOPs), JDBC, MySQL  
All with vanilla Java to gain deep conceptual clarity.

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Vanilla JavaScript — building responsive, interactive user interfaces  
- **Backend:** Core Java (Basics, OOPs, DSA), Exception Handling, Advanced Java (JDBC) — server-side programming and database connectivity  
- **Database:** MySQL, MS SQL Server (RDBMS)  
- **Tools:** npm, Git, GitHub, VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Exploring:** Python (Basics, OOPs), C (Basics), C++ (Basics)

## 📂 Projects Summary
My GitHub showcases a hands-on journey into vanilla Java full-stack development through a range of practical projects:

- Vanilla Frontend Projects (6):
I’ve built six standalone frontend projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla), and Bootstrap. These focus on user interaction, and clean UI/UX without relying on frameworks—helping me master core frontend skills:<br>1)&nbsp;<a href="lustrous-pony-b529c0.netlify.app/">Tic-Tac-Toe</a><br>2)&nbsp;<a href="helpful-sprite-519669.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Currency Converter</a>

- JDBC-Based Backend Projects (3):
Developed three backend projects integrating Java (OOPs), JDBC, and MySQL. These include management systems such as<br>
1. Hospital Management System – Admin can add and view patient-doctor records via JDBC and MySQL.<br>
